Task 2 

-\How It Works

1-Initialization: Six servo motors are defined and attached to digital pins 8 to 13 on the Arduino.

2=Setup: The setup function initializes the servo motors by attaching them to their respective pins.

3=Loop: The loop function continuously moves the servos from 0 to 180 degrees and back to 0 degrees: 

-The first for loop increments the servo position from 0 to 180 degrees.

-The second for loop decrements the servo position from 180 to 0 degrees.

-A delay of 15 milliseconds is used to allow the servos to move to the desired position smoothly.


-\Running the Project

1-Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.

2-Upload the provided code to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.

3-Power the Arduino Uno and observe the servo motors as they move from 0 to 180 degrees and back.

This project provides a basic understanding of controlling multiple servo motors with an Arduino, which can be extended for more complex robotic and automation applications.
